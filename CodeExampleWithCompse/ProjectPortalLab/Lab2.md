# CS683 Lab2

As per the instructions, I added several fields into the data class and updated the UI accordingly. These added fields include:
-	Project Authors: List<String>
-	Project Links: List<String>
-	Project Keywords: List<String>
-	isFavorite: Boolean 

Since the first three data fields are a list of String, I put each of them in an outlined text field for easy editing. However, a text field only takes String as value, I had to convert the list of String into a String, which took me some time to figure out.  To keep the style consistent, I changed the text field of project description into an outlined text field. Finally, I presented the favorite option with a check box allowing users to check or uncheck this option. 

I developed this program using Android Studio on Windows 11.

Please see the screenshots below for the final execution result.
